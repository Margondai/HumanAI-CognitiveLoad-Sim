## Abstract

This research presents a simulation framework for modeling, monitoring, and mitigating emotional overload in human-AI defense teams, leveraging real-time physiological and behavioral inputs for adaptive AI decision-making. Key findings include a 22.9% improvement in maintaining calm states and a 21.4% reduction in high-risk overloaded states.
